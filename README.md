# Advanced Initiative Tracker
A better way to track initiative when playing Rifts RPG, or any game that has multiple attacks in a single round of combat
## Version 2
Built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Svelte Materialify](https://svelte-materialify.vercel.app/getting-started/installation/)
## Demo
[Advanced Initiative Tracker v2](http://adv-init-tracker.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/) Hosted on Heroku free hosting so it may take some time to spin up.

### New Features
- [x] Add rounds - dynamically add rounds to the table
- [x] Auto add rounds with new character - if the new character's initiative is greater than the table's rounds
- [x] Negative rounds - a character with three attacks and an initiative of 1 will create negative rounds on the table so they don't lose attacks
