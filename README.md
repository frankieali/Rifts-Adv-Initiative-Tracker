## Version 2
Version 2 development is underway in the [version-2.0--svelte](https://github.com/frankieali/Rifts-Adv-Initiative-Tracker/tree/version-2.0--svelte) branch. I gave it a try with React, but row highlighting got very sluggish. I had to start memoizing components and debuging the render cycle and everything became a performance headache. So I switched to Svelte, which I've been wanting to learn for a while.

Here is the version 2 work in progress [demo](http://adv-init-tracker.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/). I will post updates as more features are added.
